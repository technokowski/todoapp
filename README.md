This is a Todo app written with FastAPI that follows along with Eric Roby's Udemy course. 

I have added a few things to make it unique, and plan on building it out with other features.
Consider it a student project, but it is up on Heroku and works. 

The SQLite3 db contains one user. The username and password is: 
testuser
testpassword

Try it out!
